As a researcher, I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of multimodal large language models, computer vision, and AI ethics. My work focuses on developing and analyzing AI systems that can process and understand both textual and visual information, with a particular emphasis on addressing biases and ethical concerns in these technologies. I'm intrigued by the potential of multimodal models to enhance human-AI interaction and enable more sophisticated problem-solving across various domains. However, I'm equally committed to critically examining the societal implications of these advancements, striving to identify and mitigate biases that may be embedded in training data or model architectures. By combining technical innovation with ethical considerations, I aim to contribute to the development of AI systems that are not only powerful and versatile but also fair, transparent, and beneficial to society as a whole.

## What I have worked on

#### EarSiamNet: Leveraging Siamese Networks and SVM for Ear Biometric Authentication

This study presents a novel biometric identification and verification method using ear characteristics. The approach employs feature extraction from ear samples, which are then processed through a one-shot classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The method is designed to be lightweight and easily deployable on edge devices, requiring minimal samples. The research demonstrates high accuracy in ear sample recognition and confirmation, with the combination of a one-shot model and Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature extractor achieving 97.857% accuracy.

Some key points:

- Designed as a lightweight model for easy deployment on edge biometric devices
- Requires a small number of samples for effective operation
- Achieves high accuracy, with 97.857% using one-shot model and HOG feature extractor

#### From Disparity to Fairness: Analyzing Challenges and Solutions in AI Systems for Disabled Individuals

AI's growing presence in society, while bringing benefits, raises concerns about bias against disabled individuals. This paper delves into this issue, exploring how AI algorithms can perpetuate discrimination. It identifies the root causes as imbalanced training data, meaning the information used to train the AI might not accurately represent disabled people. Additionally, the development of these algorithms often lacks diverse voices, excluding the experiences of people with disabilities. Societal biases about disability can also be unconsciously incorporated. Understanding these sources of bias is crucial for tackling the problem effectively. The paper then proposes solutions, emphasizing the need for a multi-pronged approach to create fairer AI.
