I'm a Masters Student at the **University of Southern California** with a keen interest in Machine Learning, particularly in the field of Computer Vision. My research interests lie in the field of Multimodal Large Language Models and the intersection of artificial intelligence and its ethical applications in real-world scenarios. I'm currently a Research Assistant at the [USC HUMANS](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/) Lab under Dr. Emilio Ferrara. I have previously worked as a Research Assistant at NMIMS University under the guidance of [Dr. Vaishali Kulkarni](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ZX1mKq4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Priyanka Verma](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=8ZY8TlsAAAAJ&hl=en) in the AI Department at NMIMS University.

I previously worked as a Software Engineer Intern at [Aerem](https://www.aerem.co/). I work on end-to-end deep learning projects starting from data collection to deployment. I have also been **Google Summer of Code Contributor** at [Unify AI](https://unify.ai/). Previously, I worked as a Computer Vision Intern at [Enord](https://enord.co/) and as a Junior Machine Learning Engineer at [Omdena](https://www.omdena.com/). I have done my undergraduate from NMIMS University.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a passion for music 🎹 and love discovering lesser-known artists. I often find myself watching <span style="color:red">Netflix</span> and enjoy becoming a human recommendation engine for friends and family. In my free time, I also enjoy cycling and have a knack for making delicious ramen 🍜
